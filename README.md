# Quotential: essential quotes

Project presents the implementation of a website, which displays and manages quotes from famous people, using the dynamic capabilities of the Django framework and the potential of the PostgreSQL database. The main goal of the site is to provide users with easily accessible, educational and motivational content in the form of celebrity quotes. Each quote in created database is cataloged with an indication of the author and relevant tags, making it easy to search and sort content by specific topics or interests. The platform also provides extensive features available to registered users. In addition to the basic ability to view citations and comments, logged-in users have the ability to add new authors, citations and comment on any quote, which promotes the growth and dynamism of the service. Moreover, all visitors to the site, have the opportunity to view more detailed information about the authors of the citations. For convenience of use, mechanisms for logging in and registration of new users, as well as a system for resetting passwords via an email. These features ensure the security of users' data and their convenience when using the site. At last, a pagination mechanism has been implemented, making it much easier to navigate the site, especially in the context of the large number of available contents. Pagination allows you to efficiently and orderly browsing of citations, which is important for ensuring good usability of the site.
